# AdventOfCode2023

My solutions to 2023's Advent of Code.

All of them can be tested using my inputs:

```
$ iex -S mix
iex> AdventOfCode2023.Day<X>.Part<Y>.solve
```

To change input modify the corresponging `assets/day<X>.in` file

Sadly no day 20 solution is present. Not having a global state meant much pain. Done in c++, though maybe someday I will revisit it.
